            I loved your card, <br>
            Baby Yoda went hard. <br><br>

            It's true! I'm so fond, <br>
            How should I respond? <br><br>

            I'm sorry if this makes you cringe, <br>
            As long as I don't hear you whinge! <br><br>

            But I have to set the record straight, <br>
            Since I met you I knew we'd date. <br><br>

            You make me laugh, you make me smile, <br>
            With you, my life's much more worthwile. <br><br>

            So all that's left for me to say, <br>
            Is thanks for making my Valentine's Day! <br><br>
