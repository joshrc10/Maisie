    <p class="poem">
        Roses are red, violets are blue, <br>
        No one in this world shines quite like you. ✨ <br><br>

        Your laughter’s a melody, soft and divine, <br>
        A song in my heart, a rhythm in time. 🎶 <br><br>

        With every glance, the stars start to glow, <br>
        Like fireflies dancing in moonlight’s soft flow. 🌙 <br><br>

        Hand in hand, through moments so sweet, <br>
        Every heartbeat whispers, “You're my heartbeat.” 💖 <br><br>

        So here’s my wish on this Valentine’s Day, <br>
        To love you forever, come what may. 💌
